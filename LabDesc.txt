Warmup
//Eric May (your name)

//8/22/2017
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;//So you don’t need to use "std::"

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";
	return 0;
}

Note the header above
Making Change
Create a program that:
Asks the user to input a number of cents
Calculates and displays the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that should be used to reach the value. EX: 67 cents would be 2 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 2 pennies
Calculates and display the total number of coins to be given back, ie 6 coins for above

Hint: The simplest way to solve this involves using the division (/) operator and modulus (%) operator. It helps to use the int data type!

When you’ve completed your assignment, you’re free to ask me to give things a quick looking over. After you’re sure you’re done, submit the .cpp file to Titanium. ***IMPORTANT*** Please name your file <last name><first initial>lab1.cpp , mine, for example, would be MayElab1.cpp . For a partnered submission with John Doe, my submission would be MayE_DoeJlab1.cpp You may lose points or even get NO credit if your submission doesn’t follow these guidelines. After you’ve done both of things, then you may leave the lab.

Points:
2 - Documentation, readability, format
1 - Accepts user input
1 - Calculating number of coins
2 - Output testing
4 - Filename and Header
